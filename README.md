This library is forked from https://github.com/keysking/k_ble_peripheral to provide adjustments to 
the library as needed for this organization's Flutter project and to keep the library up to date.

This fork is not intended to be merged into the main k_ble_peripheral project as there will be 
adjustments to the library for the intended projects in this organization as needed, and the goal 
of this fork is not intended for supporting the needs of other developers that would then depend on 
the changes to this project if it was to be merged.

## Changes:
July 9th & 12th, 2023: Updated the library to use most recent API level
July 12th, 2023: Updated README to state objectives of the fork

# Original README: 

# k_ble_peripheral

A Flutter package for using ble in Peripheral mode(both Advertising and Gatt)

## Getting Started

Before I have time to write a tutorial, you can read example to learn how to use it.

## Attention

Although I have applied it to my own project, the library is still in the development stage.
